# Analysis-of-Three-Dimensional-Atmospheric-Rivers
Codes for analysis of three-dimensional atmospheric rivers over Antarctica are stored.

The file "ar_detection_3d_monthly.py" is the three-dimensional atmospheric river detection algorithm program for ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Before running the program, you need to prepare the vertically integrated moisture transport.

The file "ar_frequency_40.py" is a code for calculation of AR mask frequency and water vapor-weighted frequency.

The file "ar_prec.py" is a code for calculation of AR-related precipitation.
